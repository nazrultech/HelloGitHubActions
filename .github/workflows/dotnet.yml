        run: dotnet restore

      # Step 4: Build the solution
      - name: Build solution
        run: dotnet build --configuration Release --no-restore

      # Step 5: Run tests with coverage
      - name: Run tests and collect coverage
        run: dotnet test --configuration Release --no-build --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage" --results-directory ./TestResults

      # Step 6: Install ReportGenerator (for coverage HTML report)
      - name: Install ReportGenerator tool
        run: dotnet tool install --global dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool

      # Step 7: Add .NET tools to PATH (so GitHub runner can find reportgenerator)
